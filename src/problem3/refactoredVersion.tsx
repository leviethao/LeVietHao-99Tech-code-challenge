// I have commented my improvements directly in the code below.
// Here is a summary of what I improved:
// 1. Ensure blockchain is present in WalletBalance
// 2. Memoize the priority calculation for each balance to avoid recomputing it multiple times.
// This can be done by extracting the priority calculation into a variable and using it in both filter and sort
// 3. The prices dependency has been removed from useMemo for sortedBalances
// 4. Add the priority as part of balance to prevent call getPriority muti times
// 5. Instead of mapping over sortedBalances twice, combine the mapping operations into one.
  // This would reduce the time complexity and improve readability.
// 6. Use currency as the key instead of the index. This ensures more stable and efficient list updates when balances change
